Allows you to display Basecamp Feeds on your WordPress.

== Description ==

This plugin was created to show users, clients or whomever a list of what is being completed with dates and times from you BaseCamp account. When you check complete in BaseCamp it will automatically reflect that change on your website in the To-Do List. It’s that simple.

We utilize this plugin to display Suggested Improvements from our users about our wordpress plugins. And how nice when you can see a Checkmark next to something that has been completed. It makes your clients or users see that you’re hard at work.

= Features include the following: =
  * Display All, Multiple or Single ToDo list(s) from a project.
  * Easily generate all the shortcodes you need for any feed with our SUPER SIMPLE shortcode generator
  * Responsive Feeds

The premium version adds the Calendar Feed option which shows a list of your calendar events. It also allows you to change text size, colors and font styles for the To-Do List feeds and the Calendar Feeds.
